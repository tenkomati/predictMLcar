predictorflask
==============================

A webapp developed in Flask for predicting car prices. it uses Mercadolibre's API and four different machine learning regression models.

Next I will add this:
-Vehicle specifications: I want to bring information about the selected car, trim levels and all the relevant information.
-Comparative analisis for same car on different years, maybe 5 year less and more.
-Historical sales data: historical sales data of the vehicle (i need to get this via a public record or something)
-photo of the car model:
-most related problems of this model:
-map of the actual offer of this model:
